- ##WHAT RECURSIVE APPROACH
  recursive approach is Solves problems by breaking them down into smaller subproblems and calling itself to solve these subproblems.
   - Requires a base case to terminate the recursion.
   - Can be more intuitive for problems that naturally fit a recursive structure (e.g., tree traversals, divide-and-conquer algorithms).
   - May use more memory due to the call stack.

  ##SUMMARYOF FINDING
  Recursive Approach
   - More intuitive for problems that can be divided into smaller subproblems.
   - Slightly higher space complexity due to the call stack (O(log n)).
   - Can lead to stack overflow for very large inputs.
